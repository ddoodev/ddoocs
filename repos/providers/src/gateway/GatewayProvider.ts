/**
 * Represents a gateway provider. Custom gateway providers must implement it.
 *
 * 1. The gateway provider operates events and connects the bot's shards to Discord.
 *
 * 2. **All events expect custom must eventually pass through the gateway manager**. (GatewayManager.emit())
 * If your provider adds new events, these events should not pass through the GatewayManager.
 * Gateway manager emits events to the client and manages events overload protection and manages cache.
 * If you use a message broker, you still must send events to the client through the gateway manager (on the recipient's side).
 *
 * 3. **WARNING:**
 * YOUR PROVIDER MUST EMIT
 * [GUILD_MEMBERS_CHUNK](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#guild-members-chunk-guild-members-chunk-event-fields)
 * AND
 * [READY](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#ready)
 * AND
 * [GUILD_CREATE](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#guild-create)
 * EVENTS WITH RAW DATA TO THE GATEWAY MANAGER REGARDLESS OF THE SITUATION.
 * IF YOU DON'T EMIT GUILD_MEMBERS_CHUNK, THE ClientMembersManager#fetchMany AND ClientMembersManager#fetch
 * AND ALL DEPENDENT FUNCTIONS WILL RETURN AN INFINITE PROMISE OR TIMEOUT ERROR.
 * IF YOU DON'T EMIT READY AND GUILD_CREATE, THE CLIENT WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO START CORRECTLY.
 * IF RUNNING IN SHARDING INSTANCE, THE CLIENT WILL BE CYCLICALLY RESTARTED.
 *
 * 4. Gateway [rate limits](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#rate-limiting) must be handled by the provider itself.
 *
